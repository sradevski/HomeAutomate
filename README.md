## Synopsis

**HomeAutomate** is a personal project with the goal of automating some appliances in my apartment. The system is built using *Raspberry Pi*, some basic electronic circuit skills, *React Native* for a simple mobile app, *nodeJS* for a server, and *Python* for the rest of the scripting involved. The end result is full control over the music player, air conditioner, and lights. They can be controlled either by a motion sensor, hardware buttons, or a mobile application.
